# gdbscan-akka-d3js

This is a learning project. The main purpose to show GDBSCAN algorithm with JS. Frontend I make use of D3js(d3.js, nv-d3.js, angular-nvd3.js and scalajs-angular) but under control of Angular style in Scala language(ok, I am a little trouble-finder). For backend, make use of akka-http, for details, please refer to https://github.com/softwaremill/bootzooka. In the middle, js will call rest web-service.
